# The Quantum Coffee Machine

## Schrödinger's Mug

Every cup is both **hot** and **cold** until you take the first sip. The machine leverages qubits brewed in a superposed kettle.

## Brewing Algorithm

1. Initialize the bean state `|espresso⟩`.
2. Apply a **Hadamard roast**.
3. Measure the aroma using a `quantum-smell` sensor.
4. Collapse the waveform into a latte or cappuccino depending on observer mood.

```python
def brew(beans: str) -> str:
    return f"{beans} => ☕"
```

## Flavor Table

| Flavor Quantum State | Taste Profile | Energy Level |
|----------------------|---------------|--------------|
| `|0⟩`                | Bold          | Low          |
| `|1⟩`                | Sweet         | High         |
| `|+⟩`                | Complex       | Medium       |

## Cleanup Routine

- Run `quantum-wipe` to reset the mug.
- Store leftover entanglement in the fridge.
- Log results in `coffee.log` for future observation.
